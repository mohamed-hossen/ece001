	<h1 > C++: </h1> 
	
	<p class=" text2" >C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.
	</p>
	
	<p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like Friend and Virtual, violate some of the very important OOPS features, rendering this language unworthy of being called completely Object Oriented. Its a middle level language.</p>

	<h1> Basic Concepts of C++</h1>
	
	<p>
In this section we will cover the basics of C++, it will include the syntax, variable, operators, loop types, pointers, references and information about other requirements of a C++ program. You will come across lot of terms that you have already studied in C language.

	<h1>Syntax and Structure of C++ program</h1>
	<h3>Here we will discuss one simple and basic C++ program to print "Hello this is C++" and its structure in parts with details and uses.</h3>

	<h1>Header files</h1>
	<p>are included at the beginning just like in C program. Here iostream is a header file which provides us with input & output streams. Header files contained predeclared function libraries, which can be used by users for their ease.</p>
	<h1>Using namespace std, </h1>
	<p> tells the compiler to use standard namespace. Namespace collects identifiers used for class, object and variables. NameSpace can be used by two ways in a program, either by the use of using statement at the beginning, like we did in above mentioned program or by using name of namespace as prefix before the identifier with scope resolution (::) operator.</p>
	<h1>main()</h1>
	<p>is the function which holds the executing part of program its return type is int.</p>
	<h1>cout <<</h1>
	<p>is used to print anything on screen, same as printf in C language. cin and cout are same as scanf and printf, only difference is that you do not need to mention format specifiers like, %d for int etc, in cout & cin.</p>

	<h1>Header Files Inclusion</h1>
	<P>The first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program.
A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.

</P>
	
	<ol>
		<h1>Some of C++ Header files:</h1>
		<li>	#inlcude iostream (Input Output Stream) :Used as a stream of Input and Output.</li>
		<li>	#include iomanip.h (Input-Output Manipulation) – Used to access set() and setprecision().</li>
		<li>s#include fstream.h (File stream) – Used to control the data to read from a file as an input and data to write into the file as an output.</li>
		
	</ol>
