		<h1>Creating Classes in C++</h1>
		<p>Classes name must start with capital letter, and they contain data variables and member functions. This is a mere introduction to classes, we will discuss classes in detail throughout the C++ tutorial.</p>

	<p>This is how a class is defined, once a class is defined, then its object is created and the member functions are used.
Variables can be declared anywhere in the entire program, but must be declared, before they are used. Hence, we don't need to declare variable at the start of the program.
Don't worry this is just to give you a basic idea about C++ language, we will cover everything in details in next tutorials.
