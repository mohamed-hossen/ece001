		<h1>Datatypes and Modifiers in C++</h1>
		<P>Let's start with Datatypes. They are used to define type of variables and contents used. Data types define the way you use storage in the programs you write. </P>
		<ol>
			<h1>Data types can be of two types
    </h1>
			<li>Bult-in data types</li>
		<li>	User-defined or Abstract Datatypes</li>
		</ol>
		<h1>Bult-in Data types</h1>
		<p>These are the datatypes which are predefined and are wired directly into the compiler. For eg: int, char etc.</p>
	<h>User defined or Abstract data types
		</h1>
		<P>These are the type, that user creates as a class or a structure. In C++ these are classes where as in C language user-defined datatypes were implemented as structures.</P>
