			</li>
			<li>Games
			<p>This language is also used for developing games. It overrides the complexity of 3D games. It helps in optimizing the resources. It supports the multiplayer option with networking. uses of C++ allows procedural programming for intensive functions of CPU and to provide control over hardware, and this language is very fast because of which it is widely used in developing different games or in gaming engines. C++ mainly used in developing the suites of a game tool.</p></li>
			<li>Animation
				<p>There is animated software, which is developed with the help of the C++ language. 3D animation, modeling, simulation, rendering software are referred to as the powerful toolset. It is widely used in building real-time, image processing, mobile sensor applications, and visual effects, modeling which is mainly coded in C++. This developed software used for animation, environments, motion graphics, virtual reality, and character creation. Virtual real devices are the most popular in todayâ€™s entertainment world.</p>
